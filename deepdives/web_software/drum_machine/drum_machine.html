          rhythms. Pads, volume, sound banks and looping can all be operated
          with the keyboard and ARIA announcements.

            <strong>Problem:</strong>
            A visually impaired friend wanted to learn basic drumming patterns,
            but most browser drum machines rely on visual pads, tiny controls
            and mouse interaction. Screen readers either ignore key controls or
            give very little feedback while playing.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
            Built a React based drum machine that can be fully controlled with
            the keyboard. It exposes semantic buttons, ARIA labels and live
            regions so screen readers announce pad hits, volume changes and loop
            state. The layout mirrors the Q W E A S D Z X C keys so the mental
            model matches the physical keyboard.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Result:</strong>
            All interactions, from power and sound bank selection to pad hits
            and looping, are accessible without a mouse. In informal testing it
            reduced the time my friend needed to set up a practice loop from
            about one minute in a traditional DAW to under 15 seconds in the
            browser.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          This project started as a small experiment to make rhythm practice
          more approachable for a visually impaired friend. The goal was not to
          compete with full digital audio workstations but to provide a focused
          tool: tap pads, hear immediate feedback, record a loop and repeat the
          pattern without fighting the interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The drum machine is built as a single page React application using
          functional components and hooks. Pads are mapped to the keys Q W E A S
          D Z X C, with both click and key support. Each pad is rendered as a
          semantic button element with ARIA labels and a visual active state for
          sighted users. A top level status region announces the last pad hit,
          power changes and loop actions so NVDA and VoiceOver users can follow
          what is happening.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Two sound banks, a classic kit and an ambient kit, can be switched
            from a select element that is accessible to both keyboard and screen
            reader users.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A power toggle, volume slider and loop recorder sit in a side panel,
            all wired to the same accessible state model so they can be
            controlled by tabbing and arrow keys.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The application is front end only, built with Create React App and
            bundled by react-scripts, which makes it easy to host as a static
            site.

        <h2>Accessibility and Features</h2>

        <p>
          The main focus was making sure the experience remains usable with only
          a keyboard and a screen reader. This required careful attention to
          semantics, focus order and announcements rather than just styling
          buttons to look like pads.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            All pads are keyboard operable and use ARIA labels plus a dedicated
            live region to announce the sound name so users confirm what they
            are triggering.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The volume slider and tempo slider expose their values through
            accessible names, allowing screen reader users to fine tune levels
            without guessing.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The loop recorder automatically stores the last 12 hits and can play
            them back at an adjustable tempo. Status messages such as “Loop
            started”, “Loop stopped” and “Loop cleared” are spoken out as they
            occur.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The interface uses a high contrast theme and focus visible styling
            so keyboard focus is easy to track for users with low vision.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In practice sessions the loop feature let my friend spend far more
            time repeating patterns than manually retriggering pads, which led
            to more consistent practice in shorter sessions.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- KEY OUTCOMES AND LEARNINGS -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key Outcomes and Learnings</h2>

        <p>
          This project reinforced how much thought is required to make even a
          simple interface truly accessible. It also highlighted how small
          changes in feedback and control design can significantly affect how
          quickly someone can start practicing.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Gained hands on experience with ARIA roles, live regions and focus
            management to support screen readers in a reactive UI.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Designed a state model that keeps visual, audio and accessibility
            feedback in sync for pads, power, sound banks, volume and loops.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Used React testing utilities to verify basic behavior such as pad
            triggers, power toggling and loop actions without relying on manual
            clicking.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Validated that small, focused tools can meaningfully lower the
            friction for visually impaired users who want to explore music and
            rhythm.
