          <li>
            <strong>Problem:</strong>
            An internal IT department managed incidents through ad hoc emails
            and spreadsheets, making it hard to see current workload, ownership
            and which tickets needed urgent attention.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
            Built OpsDesk as a single page React application backed by a Node
            and MongoDB API, providing a live dashboard with filters, attention
            flags, technician assignment, light and dark themes and full CRUD
            for system logs.

            <strong>Result:</strong>
            Delivered a production ready tool as part of a freelancing
            engagement, containerized with Docker and deployed on an AWS EC2
            instance so the client team could log, search and update tickets
            from one place instead of juggling multiple tools, saving 5 hours
            per week on average.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          OpsDesk is a custom internal application built for an IT department
          client during a freelancing engagement. The goal was to replace email
          and spreadsheet based logging with a focused dashboard that gives
          technicians a clear view of current incidents and who owns what. The
          system supports everyday helpdesk tasks such as password resets,
          network issues and hardware problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          The frontend is implemented in React using a component based
          architecture and Context API to manage global state such as filters,
          theme and technician data without prop drilling. A Node.js backend
          exposes REST endpoints that read and write to MongoDB. MongoDB was
          chosen because log entries and technician records are naturally
          document shaped, may evolve over time with new fields and are easy to
          query by status, category or technician.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application is packaged into Docker containers and deployed on an
          AWS EC2 instance, making it simple for the client to run the system in
          their environment and restart or update it with minimal downtime. The
          design emphasizes quick scanning for busy technicians with clear
          status chips, attention flags and minimal friction for creating or
          editing a log.
        </p>

            <b>
              Replaced manual email and spreadsheet workflows, saving
              technicians an average of <u>5 hours per week</u> by centralizing
              logs, ownership and updates into a single interface.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>

              Context API centralizes filters, theme and technician data so

              MongoDB collections store logs and technicians as flexible JSON

              migrations.

      <!-- KEY OUTCOMES AND LEARNINGS -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key Outcomes and Learnings</h2>

        <p>
          OpsDesk brought together full stack development, deployment and UX
          decisions into a single deliverable for a real client. It required
          balancing implementation speed with a design that technicians could
          understand at a glance and adopt without formal training.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reduced operational friction by cutting the number of steps needed
            to resolve a ticket from an average of
            <u>7–8 interactions down to 3</u>, thanks to unified filters,
            streamlined editing and centralized technician data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gained experience designing REST endpoints and data models so logs,
            technicians and categories remain easy to query and extend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it to AWS
            EC2, gaining practical experience with environment configuration and
            runtime management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focused on operator experience by adding clear status and attention
            indicators, quick actions and sortable, newest first activity feeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivered a production ready tool for an IT department client,
            improving visibility into current incidents and technician workload.
