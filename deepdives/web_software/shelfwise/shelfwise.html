        <h2>Quick Insights:</h2>

        <ul class="psr-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Problem:</strong>
            I wanted a focused place to track what I read, keep short notes and
            quickly recall why a book mattered, along with a few smart
            suggestions for what to read next.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
            Built Shelfwise, a small personal reading companion where each book
            has notes, a BERT based notes summary and inline recommendations
            driven by cosine similarity over book embeddings.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Result:</strong>
            The app turns scattered reading notes into a structured library. A
            single GraphQL query powers the main view with book details,
            summaries and recommendations, which keeps the React code simple and
            avoids multiple REST calls.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Shelfwise is a personal library application that helps me track my
          reading and capture lightweight reflections. Each entry includes a
          title, genre, author and notes. The app highlights a single current
          selection and presents the notes summary and suggested next reads side
          by side.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project is built as a small full stack system: a React.js frontend
          with Apollo Client talks to a Node and Express backend that exposes a
          GraphQL API. Data is stored in memory for easy demo and testing, which
          keeps the focus on schema design, resolver logic and UI flow rather
          than infrastructure.

      <!-- ARCHITECTURE & GRAPHQL DESIGN -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Architecture and GraphQL design</h2>

        <p>
          Shelfwise uses GraphQL as the main boundary between the React frontend
          and the Node backend. The main screen needs a mix of base data and
          derived data: raw notes, a BERT based summary and a list of similar
          books. GraphQL lets the UI fetch all of that in a single, strongly
          typed query.
        </p>

        <h3>Why GraphQL fits this project</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The main view can fetch
            <b>all data for a selected book in one round trip</b>: title, genre,
            author, notesSummary and recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Derived fields live behind resolvers.</b> The backend owns how
            summaries and recommendations are computed, while the client only
            asks for the fields it needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The schema doubles as a contract: adding future fields like rating
            or reading status is a small, discoverable change.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summarisation and recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Notes summarisation with BERT:</b>
            when a user saves notes, the backend encodes the text using a
            sentence BERT model and scores sentences by importance. The top
            sentences are stitched into a short notesSummary that fits naturally
            into the UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Recommendations via cosine similarity:</b>
            for each book, an embedding is computed from its title and a short
            description using the same BERT encoder. These embeddings are
            compared against a small open dataset of books (a filtered slice of
            the Goodbooks-10k dataset), and the closest matches by cosine
            similarity are returned as recommendations, excluding the current
            title.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- REPRESENTATIVE CODE SNIPPET -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-snippet">
        <h2>Representative GraphQL schema snippet</h2>
        <pre><code>// backend/schema.js (excerpt)

const BookType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "Book",
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID) },
    title: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    genre: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    notes: { type: GraphQLString },

    notesSummary: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      resolve: (book, args, ctx) =>
        ctx.services.summarizer.summarizeWithBert(book.notes),
    },

    recommendations: {
      type: new GraphQLList(BookType),
      resolve: (book, args, ctx) =>
        ctx.services.recommender.similarBooksByCosine(book),
    },
  }),
});

// Query { books, book(id: ID!) } and Mutation { addBook(...) } sit on top
// of this type and are used by the React UI via Apollo Client.
</code></pre>

        <p>
          The Book type exposes both stored fields and derived fields. React
          components can request title, genre, notesSummary and recommendations
          in one query, while the backend hides the BERT based summarisation and
          cosine similarity logic inside services.

      <!-- KEY OUTCOMES -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key outcomes and learnings</h2>

        <p>
          Shelfwise is a small but well rounded project that combines UI work,
          schema design and lightweight ML to improve the reading experience.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed a GraphQL schema that keeps the React components simple by
            centralising summarisation and recommendation logic on the server.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Built a responsive reading dashboard that makes it easy to add
            books, review notes and decide what to read next in one place.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Structured the backend so that the in memory data store can later be
            swapped for a persistent database without changing the GraphQL
            contract.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Used BERT embeddings and cosine similarity to add ML driven
            behaviour without complicating the frontend or the API surface.
          </li>
