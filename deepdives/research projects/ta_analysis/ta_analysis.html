        <h2>Quick insights</h2>
        <ul class="psr-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong>
            Quantify whether teaching assistant hiring decisions in a large
            computing program differ by gender, race, and student status, and
            provide data backed recommendations that departments can turn into
            policy.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Why this matters?</strong>
            Very few peer reviewed papers study TA hiring patterns, even though
            TAs are central to grading, mentoring, and classroom culture. This
            work adds a crucial but rarely measured dimension to equity work in
            computing education research.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Headline result:</strong>
            For entry level MS courses we observed that
            <b
              >Women and Non Binary (WNB) applicants were hired at markedly
              lower rates than Men</b
            >, despite comparable application patterns. For one cluster of entry
            level MS courses the effect corresponded to roughly a
            <b>42.5% shortfall</b> in WNB hires relative to their share of the
            qualified applicant pool.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>What WNB means?</strong>
            WNB refers to
            <b>Women and Non Binary applicants grouped together</b>. The number
            of non binary applicants was extremely small, which made separate
            statistical analysis unreliable and at risk of exposing individuals.
            Following common practice, we merged women and non binary applicants
            into a single category for robust and privacy preserving analysis.

      <!-- STUDY DESIGN -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Preliminary Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset spanned multiple years of TA applications for both
          undergraduate and graduate computing courses. Each record included
          applicant demographics, course applied for, instructor, and hiring
          outcome. My contribution focused on cleaning the data, building
          reproducible analysis notebooks, and constructing interactive
          visualizations that faculty could explore.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data preparation:</strong>
            Normalized course names, merged multiple application systems, and
            filtered to applicants who met minimum eligibility criteria so that
            we compared candidates who were realistically hireable.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Statistical tests:</strong>
            Used <b>Jensen Shannon Distance (JSD)</b>, two sample t-tests, and
            one way ANOVA to compare hiring outcomes across demographic groups
            and instructors.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Additional demographic analysis:</strong>
            Beyond gender, we examined patterns by race, by international versus
            domestic status, and prior teaching experience. We also ran
            <b>intersectional analyses</b> for race × gender and race ×
            international status to test whether disparities compound for
            specific groups.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- COURSE PATTERNS -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Course level application patterns</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Relative Percentage of All Applications by Course</b> (chart at
          the top) compares how often WNB and Men apply to each course. It helps
          answer two key questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do WNB candidates apply to the same types of courses as Men?</li>
          <br />
          <li>Do hiring outcomes reflect these application patterns?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Several MS level gateway courses have
          <b>substantial WNB application shares</b> that are similar to or
          higher than Men. This was important because it ruled out a simple
          explanation that WNB candidates were not applying to the courses where
          hiring imbalances appeared.

          For several introductory MS courses, WNB applicants make up a

          outcomes, the analysis revealed that
          <b
            >WNB candidates were not being hired in proportion to their
            application rates</b
          >, especially in entry level TA roles where teaching experience is

        <h2>Instructor Hiring Divergence and Jensen Shannon Distance</h2>

        <p>
          To understand where disparities originate, we needed a way to compare
          the <b>distribution of genders in the applicant pool</b> with the
          <b>distribution of genders among hires</b> for each instructor and
          course. For this we used <b>Jensen Shannon Distance (JSD)</b>.

      <section class="detail-section">
        <p>
          <b>Why Jensen Shannon Distance?</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JSD measures how different two probability distributions are and is
            <b>symmetric and bounded between 0 and 1</b>. A value of 0 means the
            hiring distribution exactly matches the applicant distribution, and
            values closer to 1 indicate strong divergence.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Unlike raw percentage gaps, JSD lets us aggregate across many
            courses with different applicant counts and still compare them
            fairly. It is also stable when some categories have small counts,
            which made it well suited for our departmental scale data.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Using JSD, we could group courses into those where hiring favored
            WNB applicants, those where hiring favored Men, and those that were
            roughly aligned with the pool. This grouping was later tested with
            t-tests and ANOVA to check which differences were statistically
            significant.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The histogram shows that a subset of courses has
          <b>consistently high JSD values skewed toward Men</b>, indicating that
          instructors in these courses hire Men at rates that diverge
          significantly from the applicant pool composition. This provided
          strong evidence that instructor level decisions, not just pipeline,
          contribute to the observed disparities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- TOPIC MODELING RESULTS -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Topic Modeling Insights</h2>
        <p>
          To understand whether WNB and Men prefer different types of courses,
          we applied topic modeling to course descriptions and grouped courses
          into themes. Key takeaways are summarized below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Topic modeling revealed that WNB applicants were more likely to
            apply to
            <b
              >project based, programming intensive, and application focused
              courses</b
            >, such as software engineering and design oriented classes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Men were more likely to apply to
            <b>math heavy and theory oriented courses</b>, including algorithms,
            machine learning theory, and systems style offerings.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            These preference differences align with prior work on gendered
            course choices, but they
            <b>did not fully explain the hiring gap</b>. Even in courses where
            WNB formed a large share of the applicant pool, hiring patterns
            still favored Men in several important MS entry level roles.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- FINDINGS AND IMPACT -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key Findings and Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Instructor decisions drive much of the disparity:</b>
            Comparing JSD values and hiring rates showed that the largest
            imbalances come from instructor level selection, not lack of WNB
            applicants. Some instructors hired close to the pool distribution,
            while others showed strong skew toward Men.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>WNB are under selected for entry level MS TA roles:</b>
            In several graduate gateway courses WNB application rates were high,
            but hires lagged significantly behind their representation,
            including an estimated <b>42.5% shortfall</b> in one entry level TA
            cluster.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Intersectional gaps matter:</b>
            Analyses by race, international status, and their intersections
            highlighted that some groups, such as international WNB applicants
            from underrepresented racial backgrounds, experience compounded
            disadvantages that would be invisible in gender only statistics.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Policy influence:</b>
            The results informed <b>equity focused recommendations</b> that were
            adopted by academic leadership for the 2025 hiring cycle, including
            structured rubrics, bias training for instructors, and department
            wide monitoring of demographic distributions in TA hiring.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Long term contribution:</b>
            This project demonstrates that TA hiring can and should be treated
            as a measurable part of equity efforts in computing. The combination
            of JSD based divergence metrics, traditional hypothesis tests, and
            interactive dashboards provides a reusable blueprint for other
            departments to audit their own processes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, the analysis showed that while application patterns and topic
          preferences differ slightly by gender, the
          <b
            >largest disparities come from how instructors convert applicants
            into hires</b
          >. This makes TA hiring an essential and previously overlooked
          dimension of diversity work in computing education.
