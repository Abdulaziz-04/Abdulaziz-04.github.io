      <!-- QUICK INSIGHTS -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Quick insights</h2>
        <ul class="psr-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong>
            A 2-week quick sprint to give university students a lightweight
            place to chat in focused rooms, share campus updates, and ask
            questions without needing to trade phone numbers or social media
            handles.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Approach:</strong>
            Built a real-time group messaging app using Flutter and Firebase
            where users register and login with email and join pre-defined rooms
            like Campus Updates, Career Discussion, Unpopular Opinions and
            Programming Help.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Result:</strong>
            Delivered a responsive Android app with real-time Firestore-backed
            chat, handling multiple clients, consistent performance across
            devices, and a UI simple enough for first-time smartphone users.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- SYSTEM OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>System overview</h2>
        <p>
          FlashChat is structured as a thin Flutter front end on top of Firebase
          backend services. All messaging is live, with Firestore handling
          persistence and real-time streams, which keeps the client code small
          and focused on UI and state management.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Authentication and privacy:</b>
            Uses Firebase Authentication email and password sign in. Only the
            user email is stored as an identifier in chat messages, which keeps
            the profile surface minimal while still allowing basic identity in
            rooms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Real-time messaging:</b>
            Messages are added to a room collection in Cloud Firestore and
            streamed back to all subscribed clients using real-time listeners.
            This keeps chats synchronized across devices without manual polling.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Room model:</b>
            Each chat room is a Firestore document with its own messages
            subcollection. Rooms are currently curated to keep content focused.
            Students can quickly hop between rooms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Client deployment:</b>
            The Flutter app is compiled to an Android APK and uploaded to google
            drive, so that testers and classmates can download and install
            builds during development.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- FEATURES -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Student-centered features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Topic rooms for campus life:</b>
            Separate rooms for programming help, physics questions, career
            advice, sci-fi discussions, and general hangouts. This reduces noise
            and lets students pick the social context they want.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Simple, friendly UI:</b>
            Chat bubbles, clear timestamps, and large buttons make the app
            approachable. Animations and subtle colors highlight which messages
            are yours versus others.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Real-time delivery:</b>
            Messages appear instantly across clients using Firestore streams,
            creating the feel of a live group chat rather than delayed forum
            posts.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Low-friction onboarding:</b>
            New users only need an email and password to start chatting. There
            is no complex profile form or friend-request flow to get in the way.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Lightweight and portable:</b>
            The app is small enough to install quickly and runs smoothly on
            lower-end Android devices and on iOS platforms as well, which was
            important for a mixed hardware student population.
          </li>

      <!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Development process</h2>
        <p>
          The project was scoped as a two week build, split into learning,
          implementation, and testing phases.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Days 1 - 4:</b>
            Learned Dart, the Flutter widget model, and the project file
            structure. Set up the Flutter SDK, Android tooling, and Firebase
            project.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Days 5 - 8:</b>
            Built the initial UI, wired up navigation between login, room list,
            and chat screens, and connected Firebase Authentication plus Cloud
            Firestore reads and writes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Days 9 - 14:</b>
            Tested on multiple screen sizes and phones, improved performance,
            refined animations, and adjusted layouts so that chat bubbles and
            input fields behave correctly on different devices.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- IMPACT AND FUTURE WORK -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Impact and learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Real-time mobile experience:</b>
            Built a production-style real-time chat using Firebase Firestore
            listeners, which later informed how I structure data and indexes for
            other mobile projects.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Student community focus:</b>
            Learned how topic-based rooms and a simple, low-friction UI can
            encourage more shy students to participate and ask questions that
            might not show up on public social media.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Future improvements:</b>
            Planned enhancements include one-to-one DMs, media sharing, custom
            room creation, usernames instead of raw emails and stronger
            end-to-end privacy controls.
