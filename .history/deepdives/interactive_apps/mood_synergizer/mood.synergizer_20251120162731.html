          Desktop application that reads a user’s facial expression from the

      <!-- QUICK INSIGHTS -->

        <h2>Quick insights</h2>
        <ul class="psr-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong>
            Turn a webcam into a simple “mood remote” that can pick up a user’s
            expression and start music that matches how they feel without extra
            clicks.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Approach:</strong>
            Capture a snapshot from the webcam, run DeepFace emotion analysis on
            device, map the detected mood to a local playlist, and provide a
            dedicated music player window with full playback controls.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong>
            A responsive desktop app that lets users go from neutral desktop to
            “music that fits my mood” in a single click while keeping all images
            and predictions on their own machine.

      <!-- USER EXPERIENCE -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>User experience</h2>
        <p>
          Mood Synergizer is designed to feel like a small companion on the side
          of a workspace. The main window shows a live camera preview, a clear
          “Take Snapshot &amp; Detect” button, and a mood label that updates
          once detection finishes. From there, a second window opens for the
          music player so the user can minimize the camera and just enjoy the
          playlist.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Large, high contrast buttons and labels make it easy to use even
            while multitasking.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The player window surfaces the current mood at the top and shows a
            simple list of available tracks for that mood.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Playback controls include play, pause, stop, next, and previous so
            users can stay on a mood but still skip individual tracks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>How it works end to end</h2>
        <p>
          Under the hood, the application wires together real time video
          capture, emotion classification, and a lightweight audio engine.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Webcam capture:</b>
            OpenCV streams frames from the default camera into the Tkinter
            window. A snapshot button freezes the current frame and saves it
            locally for analysis.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Emotion detection:</b>
            DeepFace runs a pre trained emotion model on the snapshot and
            returns the dominant emotion label such as happy, sad, angry,
            neutral, or surprised.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Mood to playlist mapping:</b>
            Each emotion maps to a specific folder of songs on disk. If a mood
            has no configured folder, the system falls back to a peaceful
            playlist so the user always gets a calming result instead of an
            error. Current mood categories are "Happy", "Sad", "Angry",
            "Peaceful"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Music playback:</b>
            pygame.mixer loads all supported audio files in that folder, starts
            playing the first track automatically, and exposes controls to move
            forward or backward through the list while updating status text such
            as “Now playing”.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ROBUSTNESS & SAFETY -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Robustness and safety</h2>
        <p>
          Since this is a camera based application, error handling and privacy
          were important parts of the implementation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The app defends against missing cameras or driver issues by showing
            status messages and disabling detection until a stream is available.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            If a mood folder has no songs, it gracefully drops into a peaceful
            playlist rather than failing. This keeps the experience positive
            even when configuration is incomplete.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            All snapshots and emotion predictions stay on the local machine. No
            frames are uploaded to a remote server.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On exit, the application stops playback, releases the camera, and
            closes all windows cleanly to avoid locking audio or camera
            resources.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- FUTURE WORK -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Future directions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Spotify integration:</b>
            Extend the mood to playlist mapping to call the Spotify Web API and
            fetch personalized playlists based on the detected emotion and the
            user’s listening history.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Richer mood taxonomy:</b>
            Group similar emotions into broader categories like focus, relax,
            and energize, then blend playlists across moods.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Session analytics:</b>
            Add optional local logs so users can see which moods and playlists
            they trigger most often and how long they listen.
