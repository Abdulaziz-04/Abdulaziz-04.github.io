            Build a portfolio management system that can expand over multiple

            Designed a modular Java application using MVC and MVVM patterns,
            introduced helper models, factories, command objects and mock
            components for testability, and extended the system with flexible
            portfolios, investment plans, rebalancing and visualization.

            testing layers.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section class="detail-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Portfolio Analyzer was built as a multi-iteration project focused on
          applying SOLID principles and evolving a basic console application
          into a robust GUI driven financial tool. MVC formed the foundation,
          later extended with MVVM-style separation for Swing views to reduce
          UI-logic coupling.
        </p>

        <p>
          To keep the code extensible, I introduced factories for portfolio
          types, helper models for validation and caching, command pattern for
          user operations and modular interfaces for adding new features
          incrementally. Market data retrieval used the AlphaVantage API with
          caching and date validation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Testing was a major focus: mock models, mock views and mock
          controllers enabled isolated testing of all layers. Contract tests
          ensured feature additions never broke earlier assignments.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >10+ major features added across iterative assignments without
              modifying core contracts.</b
            >
          </li>

            <b
              >Rebalancing functionality introduced to redistribute portfolio
              weights automatically.</b
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b
              >Integrated ElasticSearch to index portfolio snapshots and allow
              faster search and analysis.</b

      <!-- KEY OUTCOMES AND LEARNINGS -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key Outcomes and Learnings</h2>

        <p>
          The project emphasized extensibility, testability and design-driven
          development. It combined architectural patterns with API integration,
          caching, visualization and portfolio analytics.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Applied SOLID principles by introducing new features through helper
            interfaces, factories and strategy components without editing stable
            logic.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Strengthened understanding of MVC and MVVM by separating domain
            logic from views and wiring multiple interfaces to the same core
            models and controllers.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Gained experience collaborating on and extending another team’s
            codebase while respecting previously defined contracts and behavior.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Used ElasticSearch to index portfolio data and perform trend
            analysis.
          </li>
