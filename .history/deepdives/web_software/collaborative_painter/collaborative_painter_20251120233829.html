        <b>
          A real time collaborative drawing platform built in DLang using SDL
          and UDP networking. Multiple users can paint, chat, and share a
          dynamic canvas together with synchronized updates across all connected
          clients.

            <strong>Problem:</strong>
            The client needed a fast desktop tool that allowed multiple users to
            collaboratively paint on a shared canvas while staying synchronized
            and communicating in real time.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
            A DLang based collaborative painter using SDL and gtkD for rendering
            and UI, with UDP networking to broadcast drawing commands and chat
            updates efficiently across clients.
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <strong>Result:</strong>
            Fully working prototype supporting 10 concurrent users, real time
            synchronization, integrated chat, and unit tested core features for
            drawing and networking.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          This project was developed as part of the Foundations of Software
          Engineering course at Northeastern University. Our team of 4 people
          designed and implemented a desktop application that enables users to
          collaboratively paint on a shared canvas while communicating in real
          time through an integrated chat panel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The client requested a high performance, portable, low latency
          collaborative system. DLang was chosen due to its performance and
          memory safety benefits, along with its use in large scale systems such
          as Facebook infrastructure tools. SDL and gtkD enabled rendering and
          UI development, while UDP allowed lightweight real time message
          broadcasting. Core features were unit tested using unit threaded
          testing to ensure stability.

      <!-- KEY OUTCOMES AND LEARNINGS -->
      <section class="detail-section detail-impact">
        <h2>Key Outcomes and Learnings</h2>

        <p>
          This project demonstrated distributed system design, low latency
          networking and event driven programming. It also required strong team
          coordination, sprint based planning and the adoption of new languages
          and tools aligned with client constraints.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Learned how to architect a collaborative real time application using
            UDP message passing.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Strengthened team collaboration through milestones, shared ownership
            and structured agile workflow.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Built experience with DLang, SDL rendering, gtkD UI development and
            performance optimization for drawing tools.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Developed unit tested components for networking and rendering to
            prevent regressions during feature expansion.
          </li>
