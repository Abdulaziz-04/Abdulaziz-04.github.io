              <h3>
                Software Engineer, Data Science Org. &middot; Intel Corporation
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Led the conversion of legacy .NET wafer analysis workflows to
                  Python, leveraging Python-Net and subprocess integration to
                  reuse 40+ existing DLL libraries, saving 80+ hours of
                  development time while enabling seamless execution of .NET
                  code in python environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engineered low-code data visualization modules on the GENIE
                  platform using Django, Angular, and Docker, generating
                  JSON-based chart configurations automatically via dataclasses,
                  improving visualization efficiency by 35% over manual methods
                  for wafer and engineering analytics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Optimized SQL query pipelines for multi-factory wafer data
                  using multi-threading and batch processing, reducing data
                  processing time from 2500 seconds to 1200 seconds, ensuring
                  faster downstream analysis and timely reporting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deployed a containerized LLM-RAG microservice on AWS ECS to
                  standardize 600+ excursion reports, integrating OpenAI
                  embeddings, LangChain and FastAPI, cutting root cause analysis
                  time by 75% and saving approximately $100,000 annually in
                  labor costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, integrating Xunit
                  and Jest for testing and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring,
                  which reduced wafer analysis reporting latency by 60% and
                  improved dashboard reliability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tuned large-scale regression models in PyTorch using Bayesian
                  optimization; improved E-test prediction accuracy by 22% with
                  9 sites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used Apache Spark and Docker to automate ML pipeline
                  orchestration, reducing model update time from 2 hours to
                  under 30 mins.
